            <div class="Line"></div>

            <h3>WHAT IS PHYSICAL THERAPY?</h3>
            <p>Physical therapy is the science of movement and function. Physical therapist use a variety of techniques
                including strengthening, stretching, splinting and bracing, manual joint mobilization, balance
                retraining,
                and
                motor relearning to promote improvements in a person's function.</p>
            <p>In addition, a physical therapist may use physical agents such as various types of electrical
                stimulation,
                ultrasound, cryotherapy, and thermal therapy to enhance tissue healing and decrease pain.</p>

            <div class="Line"></div>

            <h3>WHAT EDUCATION DO THERAPISTS HAVE?</h3>

            <p>The minimum educational level to practice physical therapy is a Bachelor's in Physical Therapy.</p>
            <p>The majority of Physical Therapists have a Masters in Physical Therapy which requires a four year
                Bachelor's
                degree and then another two to three years for a Master's in Physical Therapy</p>
            <p>Most therapy schools have now gone to the Doctorate level which requires a Bachelor's degree and then two
                and
                a
                half to four years of intense study for a Doctorate in Physical Therapy.</p>
            <p>There are a few therapists such as our owner, Glenn Dodge DPT, who earned a Masters in Physical Therapy
                and
                practiced therapy for a number of years before going back to school for a Doctorate in Physical Therapy.
                This is
                the highest level of clinical education as it requires both experience as a treating therapist (most
                schools
                require a minimum of 3 years experience) and clinical education at a Doctoral level.</p>

            <h3>WHY SHOULD I GO TO ONTARIO PHYSICAL THERAPY?</h3>
            <p>At Ontario Physical Therapy, we follow three principles that we believe sets us apart from other physical
                therapy
                clinics.</p>

            <p>We are committed to evidence based practice.</p>
            <p class="sub">Evidence based practice what? What does this mean? Evidence based practice means that we
                utilize
                the
                most current and valid research to formulate our treatment plan. We also take into account our clinical
                judgment
                and expertise as well as the patient's needs and values in formulating that plan. By utilizing evidence
                based
                practice, we rely on proven techniques rather than on "what's worked in the past" or the latest
                treatment
                fad or
                gadget.</p>

            <p>A Person is a Whole Being, Not a Collection of Parts.</p>

            <p class="sub">We recognize that a holistic approach to therapy works. Walking, throwing a ball, and picking
                up
                your
                child are all activities that require complex interactions between all of your body's systems and
                therefore
                the
                psychological, neurological and musculo-skeletal systems must be taken into account in order to regain
                these
                functions.</p>
            <p class="sub">We do not believe that physical therapy is the "be all, end all" to treatment. We work
                closely
                with
                chiropractors, surgeons, physicians, and other practitioners to afford the best overall result for the
                client. In
                fact, we have found that with clients that have severe or complex problems, a coordinated approach with
                the
                other
                disciplines will often work when other attempts at therapy have failed.</p>

            <p>A Person is an Individual</p>

            <p class="sub">At Ontario Physical Therapy, we believe that every person is unique and that a one size fits
                all
                approach to therapy does not produce optimal results. Listening to our clients problems, values and
                goals
                and
                incorporating these into our treatment plan as well as involving our clients in the creation of their
                own
                treatment plan provides superior and longer lasting results.</p>
            <p class="sub">In addition, we believe that one on one treatment between the client and therapist are the
                way to
                develop an individualized approach. Therefore, we do not utilize aides or technicians in our therapy
                treatment.
                All treatment is provided by licensed therapists.</p>
            <p class="sub">Lastly, the time you are in therapy is based on your needs and not on pre-determined
                schedules
                (such
                as &#189; hour treatment times). So, if a client needs an hour of one on one treatment or even more then that
                is
                what
                he or she will be scheduled.</p>
